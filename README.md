# Elixir/OTP Training Project
This is a simple Elixir/OTP project developed while taking the [Developing With Elixir/OTP](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elixir) video course.

I highly recommend taking the [course](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elixir) if you are interested in learning Elixir/OTP. There is also a free trial period to get started.
